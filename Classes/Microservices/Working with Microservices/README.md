For a long time, web applications were usually a single application that handled everything—in other words, a monolithic application. This monolith handled user authentication, logging, sending email, and everything else. While this is still a popular (and useful) approach, today, many larger scale applications tend to break things up into **microservices**. Today, most large organizations are focused on building web applications using this approach, and with good reason.

**Microservices**, also known as the microservice architecture, are an architectural style which structures an application as a loosely coupled collection of smaller applications. The microservice architecture allows for the rapid and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. Some of the most common features for a microservice are:

- it is maintainable and testable;
- it is loosely coupled with other parts of the application;
- it  can deployed by itself;
- it is organized around business capabilities;
- it is often owned by a small team.

In this course, we'll develop a number of small, self-contained, loosely coupled microservices that will will communicate with one another and a simple front-end application with a **REST API**, with **RPC**, over **gRPC**, and by sending and consuming messages using **AMQP**, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. The microservices we build will include the following functionality:

- A Front End service, that just displays web pages;
- An Authentication service, with a Postgres database;
- A Logging service, with a MongoDB database;
- A Listener service, which receives messages from RabbitMQ and acts upon them;
- A Broker service, which is an optional single point of entry into the microservice cluster;
- A Mail service, which takes a JSON payload, converts into a formatted email, and send it out.

All of these services will be written in Go, commonly referred to as Golang, a language which is particularly well suited to building distributed web applications.

We'll also learn how to deploy our distributed application to a **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes**, and how to scale up and down, as necessary, and to update individual microservices with little or no downtime.

## Introduction

### What we'll build

We'll communicate from between Microservices using:

- REST API with JSON as transport
- Sending & Receiving using RPC
- Sending & Receiving using gRPC
- Initiating and responding to events using Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
