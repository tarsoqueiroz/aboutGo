> `https://gobyexample.com/`

[Go](https://go.dev/) is an open source programming language designed for building simple, fast, and reliable software. Please read the [official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) to learn a bit about Go code, tools packages, and modules.

Go by Example is a hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs. Check out the [first example](https://gobyexample.com/hello-world) or browse the full list below.

## [Hello World](https://gobyexample.com/hello-world)

```sh
go run hello-world.go 

go build  hello-world.go 

./hello-world 
```
