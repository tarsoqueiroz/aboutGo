## About

Week by week Building Microservices builds on the previous weeks code teaching you how to build a multi-tier microservice system. The code structure for the course is one of a mono repo. To make it simple to follow along, each episode has its own branch showing progress to date.

### Series Content

Over the weeks we will look at the following topics, teaching you everything you need to know regarding building microservices with the go programming language:

- Introduction to microservices
- RESTFul microservices
- gRPC microservices
- Packaging applications with Docker
- Testing microservice
- Continuous Delivery
- Observability
- Using Kubernetes
- Debugging
- Security
- Asynchronous microservices
- Caching
- Microservice reliability using a Service Mesh
