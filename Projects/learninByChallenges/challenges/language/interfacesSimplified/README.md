if you're starting with golang, you probably heard about interfaces, but you may not fully understand how they work.
Interfaces are one of the most powerful concept in the lang, allowing you to write flexible and reusable code.

## Actions

```sh
go mod init interfacesimple

# v1 simples interface
#   demonstrating polymorphism in Go.
go run main.go

# v2 empty interface
#   use with caution to avoid type loss and the need for type asserts.
go run main.go
```
