> `https://dev.to/skillcr/handling-errors-in-go-a-simple-example-24k7`

Effective error handling is crucial for building robust Go applications. Hereâ€™s a straightforward example of error handling in Go:

## Code Example

- Code 1: [`main1.go`](./main1.go)
- Code 2: [`main2.go`](./main2.go)

## Running the Code

To run this code use the following command to execute it:

```sh
go run main1.go

go run main2.go
```

You will see the output based on whether the simulated error is processed or not.
