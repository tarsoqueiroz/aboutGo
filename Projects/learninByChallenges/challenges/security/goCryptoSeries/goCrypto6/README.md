# Digital Signatures: Your Cryptographic John Hancock, Go Crypto 6

## RSA Signatures: The Classic Autograph

It's like signing a document with a really fancy, unforgeable pen.

## ECDSA Signatures: The Curvy Autograph

It's like RSA's cooler, more efficient cousin - smaller signatures with the same level of security.

## Ed25519 Signatures: The Speed Demon Autograph

These are like the sports car of digital signatures - fast and secure.

## Choosing Your Perfect Signature

Now, you might be wondering, "Which signature should I use?" Well, it depends on your needs:

- **RSA:** It's like the Swiss Army knife of signatures. Widely supported, but the signatures are a bit chunky.
- **ECDSA:** It's the middle ground. Smaller signatures than RSA, still widely supported.
- **Ed25519:** The new kid on the block. Super fast, small signatures, but might not be supported everywhere yet.

## The Golden Rules of Digital Signatures

Now that you're a signature artist, here are some golden rules to keep in mind:

- **Randomness is key:** Always use crypto/rand for anything related to signatures. Predictable randomness is like using the same signature every time - not good!
- **Hash before you sign:** Except for Ed25519, always hash your message before signing. It's like creating a unique fingerprint of your message.
- **Size matters:** Use at least 2048 bits for RSA, 256 bits for ECDSA, and Ed25519 is always 256 bits.
- **Keep your pens safe:** Protect your private keys like you'd protect your most precious possessions. A stolen signing key is like someone stealing your identity!
- **Verify your verifiers:** Make sure the public keys you're using to verify signatures are legit. A fake public key could make you trust a fake signature!
- **Standardize when possible:** Consider using formats like JSON Web Signature (JWS) if you need to play nice with other systems.
- **Be aware of sneaky attacks:** In high-security scenarios, watch out for side-channel attacks. They're like someone peeking over your shoulder while you sign.

## Coding

```sh
# initiating code
go mod init gocrypto6
# program
touch main.go
# importing modules
go get 
# running code
go run main.go 
```

## That's all

...folks!!!
