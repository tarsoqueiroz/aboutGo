## Why Constant-Time? Because Timing is Everything!

Imagine you're trying to guess someone's password. If the system tells you "Wrong!" faster for some guesses than others, you might deduce that the faster rejections mean you got some characters right. That's a timing attack, and it's exactly what constant-time operations are designed to prevent.

In the world of cryptography, we want our operations to take the same amount of time regardless of the input. It's like having a poker face, but for your code!

### Constant-Time Comparison: The Secret Handshake

The most common constant-time operation is comparison. It's like checking if two secret handshakes match, without giving any hints about how close they are. Go gives us ConstantTimeCompare for this:

> [`main.go`](./goCrypto9-a/main.go)

Remember, ConstantTimeCompare returns 1 for a match and 0 for a mismatch. It's like a silent nod or shake of the head - no extra information given!

### Constant-Time Selection: The Invisible Choice

Sometimes we need to choose between two values based on a secret condition. It's like picking a card without letting anyone see which one you chose. Go's ConstantTimeSelect lets us do just that:

> [`main.go`](./goCrypto9-b/main.go)

No matter which door we choose, it takes the same amount of time. It's like being a master magician - the audience can't tell which hand the coin is in!

### Constant-Time Boolean Operations: Secret Logic

Sometimes we need to perform logical operations on secret values. Go's subtle package has us covered:

> [`main.go`](./goCrypto9-c/main.go)

It's like doing math in your head - no one can tell what operations you're performing!

## The Golden Rules of Constant-Time Operations

Now that you're a master of cryptographic stealth, here are some golden rules to keep in mind:

- **Always use `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for sensitive comparisons:** It's like using a special pair of glasses that make all secret handshakes look the same length.
- **Equal length inputs are key:** `ConstantTimeCompare` only works its magic on equal-length inputs. It's like comparing secret handshakes - they should have the same number of moves!
- **Use `ConstantTimeSelect` for secret-based choices:** When you need to choose based on a secret, use this to keep your choice... well, secret!
- **Remember, it's not just about the operation:** The code around your constant-time operations can still leak information. It's like being a magician - every move matters, not just the trick itself.
- **Don't roll your own crypto:** These functions are tools, not an invitation to invent your own cryptographic algorithms. It's like cooking - use the recipe before you try to invent a new dish!
- **Constant-time is just one ingredient:** It's an important part of cryptographic security, but not the whole meal. Always consider the bigger security picture.

## That's all
