## What's the Big Deal with Cryptography?

- Keep your secrets secret (data protection)
- Make sure you're really you (authentication)
- Prevent sneaky data tampering (integrity)
- Prove who said what (non-repudiation)
- Create secure chat rooms in the digital world (secure communication)

## Enter Go's Crypto Package

- A whole bunch of cryptographic building blocks (we call them primitives)
- Tools for both symmetric encryption (same key to lock and unlock) and asymmetric encryption (different keys for locking and unlocking)
- Various hash functions to create digital fingerprints of your data
- Everything you need to work with digital signatures and certificates
- A secure random number generator (because random numbers in cryptography need to be really, really random)
- Special functions that always take the same amount of time to run (to outsmart those sneaky timing attacks)

## Why Should You Care?

- Thoroughly tested and vetted by the Go community
- Consistently updated and maintained
- Designed to work seamlessly with other Go packages
- Available right out of the box - no need to manage external dependencies
